#  Simple Calculator (C Project)

A lightweight **Simple Calculator** built in pure **C language** that performs both **basic** and **advanced mathematical operations**.  
Designed with a **clean, class-wise menu system** and a **fresh-page (clear screen)** effect for better console experience.  

---

##  Features

- **Basic Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- **Advanced Operations:** Square Root, Power, Factorial  
- **Smart Input Handling:** Detects invalid entries and prevents crashes  
- **Dynamic Page Refresh:** Uses a cross-platform clear screen system

##  Technology Used

- Language: **C**
- Libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `math.h`
- Tested Environment: **Code::Blocks**, **Turbo C**, **GCC**, and **OnlineGDB**

##  How to Run

###  On Local Compiler (Recommended)
1. Open the code in **Code::Blocks**, **Dev-C++**, or **any offline C compiler**.  
2. Build and run the program normally.  
3. You’ll experience **smooth clear-screen transitions** between menus.

###  On Online Compiler (Limited Behavior)
- Some online compilers **do not support** the `system("cls")` or `system("clear")` command.  
- In such environments, the program still works, but the **clear-screen effect** may not display properly.  
- If you see text shifting or stacking instead of clearing, that’s normal in restricted environments.
